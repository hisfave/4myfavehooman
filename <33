hi, my love! its been 6 months since we ended, yet i'm still hereâ€”inlove and waiting for you to comeback. hon, i'm sorry for causing you so much pain. may mga nalaman ako, and mahal, i hate what you did, you lied to me. bakit ka ganyan? hindi na ikaw 'yong seven na nakilala ko, you've changed a lot. 


every night, everyday, every minute, imissyou, and whenever i'm sad, i play the songs that you recommended. i miss your hugs and kisses. hon, why do i always comeback to you? ginayuma mo talaga ako. 


i'm wishing you all the best, take care of yourself always, wear your genuine smile. enjoy every moment of your life. i'm always here for you, seven. you are the greatest gift that i ever received. 


mahal, i'll fulfill my promise to you. hihintayin kita, ikaw lang palagi. thank you for making me feel what the real love feels like, thank you for everything, my love. mahal kita, palagi. iloveyou and imissyousomuch, honey. you are and you will always be my home. 


ang gwapo mo palagi, mahal ko. pipiliin ka sa araw-araw. 


it's nice to meeting you, it's nice to be with you. 


if there's a next time, meet me in amsterdam.
ikaw lang ang iniibig, ikaw pa rin ang iibigin, sa susunod na habang buhay.  

be happy, my love.
